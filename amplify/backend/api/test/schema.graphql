# Designed to be compatable with Datastore
# Key notes:
# 1. primary keys MUST be id: ID!
# 2. does not support circle references (referencing something that has references the original item)
# This is an issue because it prevents proper queries which would allow

# Issues
# 1. Due to Datastore's nature of downloading everything, people will have access to all customers, which is not secure
# May be combated with better use of @auth (unsure), or seperating Datastore from sensitive information entirely
