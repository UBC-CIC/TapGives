# Requirements

Before you launch, you must have the following piece of information:
- API Gateway Endpoint to the deployed ussd-app project.

# Africa's Talking

Firstly, create an Africa's Talking account, [here](https://africastalking.com/).  

Once you have created an account, follow these steps to:
1. Create a service code (USSD Shortcode) and 
2. Connect the service code to the deployed AWS application.

And that's it! Any request to the USSD short code provided will be routed to your AWS application.
